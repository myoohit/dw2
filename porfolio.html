In the health sector, policies are being implemented to improve the quality of care, while the government is also increasing its commitment to renewable energy through expanded solar and wind projects as part of its climate action goals. Additionally, the Digital India initiative aims to improve internet access in rural areas and streamline government services, alongside education reforms designed to enhance the quality of education and provide skill development opportunities for youth.
